    <h1> Healthy Recipes for Working People </h1>

    Nutritious, quick-to-prepare dishes are especially valuable to working people in the
    so-called gig economy and may segment their schedule into multiple "side hustles".
    You may fall under this category, or perhaps can relate: you have scarce time and may 
    otherwise resort to other convenient options which may be less healthy to consume due 
    to preservatives or fast food / fast casual restaraunt practices. Nonetheless, there 
    are suitable meals which take only a few minutes to prepare, and you may even save
    your hard-earned cash!
